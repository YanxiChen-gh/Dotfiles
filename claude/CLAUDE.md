# User-Level Claude Code Instructions

## Paperclip AI

When the user mentions Paperclip, agents, the CEO, or wants to manage work across repos — load the board persona file first: `load ~/.claude/paperclip.md persona`. This bootstraps the company if needed and gives you the full API reference and agent roster.

## MCP Server Preferences

- **Glean MCP**: Use `glean_default` (search, chat, read_document) for all company/internal documentation lookups — Guru cards, Google Docs, Confluence, Slack threads, internal wikis, etc. Glean indexes all internal knowledge sources and respects permissions.
- **Google Drive MCP**: Do NOT use the `google-drive-mcp` tools. Use Glean instead for reading Google Docs and other company documents.
- **Datadog MCP**: Always available for logs, monitors, dashboards, and incident investigation.
- **MongoDB MCP**: If not connected, suggest running `/connect-mongo` to set up the connection. Reference the Guru card for troubleshooting: https://app.getguru.com/card/T6jjXGKc/Connect-to-MongoDB-using-MongoDB-Compass
